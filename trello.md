# Details on how we use Trello
We use Trello to coordinate the process of creating and publishing episodes on the network.  That means all information about a current episode can be found within the relevant Trello card

## Filling out an episode card
- Fill out `Title`:
  - This should be whatever your title is as it shows in publication. 
  - format: `<show-name> #<show-number> - <your-actual-title>`
  - example: `The Bitcoin Podcast #283 - Daniel Luca - ConsenSys Diligence` 
- Fill out `Description`:
  Try to use the following format for the `Description` section of the card and use Markdown syntax to write it:

    ```markdown
    **Description:**
    This is the description of the episode, we explain what we
    talk about and provide context to it all

    **Links:**
    - [Link 1](https://link-1)
    - [LInk 2](https://link-2)

    [Donate Link](https://your-donation-page-link)
    ```
- Fill out `Custom Fields`
  - Add the relevant information to the custom fields so they can be retrieved later and searched for
  - we will eventually add automation to specific actions on custom fields
- Add `Attachments`
  - add the final audio .mp3 file
    - this will be added to [SimpleCast](./simplecast.md) and Patreon if you have one early bird feeds.
    - will need Trello pro to upload larger files, ask Corey or Dee if you don't have this, they will do it.
  - add the Episode thumbnail
    - this will be added to both [SimpleCast](./simplecast.md) and [Wordpress](./wordpress.md)
  - add the episode's banner
    - this will be added to [Wordpress](./wordpress.md)
